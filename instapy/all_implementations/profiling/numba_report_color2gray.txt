Comments on Numba vs NumPy
Numba is used for optimizing general Python-code, compiling it just-in-time.
NumPy utilized vectorized calls, and can be more specifically optimized for array iteration.
While Numba proves effective in optimizing pure Python-code, speeding up the performance 4 times, it doesn't come close to the performance of NumPy.
